# Car Application

### Description
  - This application is designed to allow potential users to browse, search and filter among the available cars listed in the application.

### Assumptions 
  - To do the project, some assumptions were made as follows.
    - 1. Users prefer to first browse and search for the cars' make and then see the details of the available models of the chosen manufacturer.
    - 2. For filtering based on years, users prefer to see the available car models of a specific year instead of a period.
    - 3. For now, there are no specific images for the cars. The same image can be used everywhere.
